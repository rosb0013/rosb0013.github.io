                        inviting environment for students of all backgrounds, cultures and abilities to

                    <p>is this going to cost me? This facility will be included in your activity
                        fee. All fee-paying students can use and participate in all activities in the
                        building. As for the facility, it will cost Algonquin College $48.8 million.</p>
                    <h2>Where</h2>
