My Portfolio site has been created utilizing Bootstrap as much as possible. The way Bootstrap streamlines development is a godsend when it comes to quickly creating and adjusting content, making layout edits with grids. 

Challenges
Determining ideal content amount to not overwhelm mobile usage.
Emebding video: Discovered how to embed YouTube content from my personal YouTube portfolio to bypass the need for direct content upload to a folder on my site, using space that can remain free. 

Working with Bootstrap Embeds for YouTube content

    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
    <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="..." allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>

    Struggled with sizing for embeded YouTube content (still unable to rectify this to my satisfaction)

When HTML validating, received the following error, however when checking BOOTSTRAP nav help, I cannot find any error.
    Error: Stray start tag nav.

    From line 41, column 1; to line 41, column 59

    N BAR -->↩<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">↩    <

    Fatal Error: Cannot recover after last error. Any further errors will be ignored.

    From line 41, column 1; to line 41, column 59

    N BAR -->↩<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">↩    <


Overcoming Challenges
Challenges such as this were quickly overcome as Bootstrap makes it easy to adjust rows/columns, locations, layout, etc. 
The Bootstrap site contains EXTENSIVE examples for EVERY component and class(es) access.
Determining ideal grid layout(s) was achieved through trial and error.
